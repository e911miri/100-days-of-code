# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Januaty 1, 2017
##### Deciding what to code by coding

**Today's Progress**: Forked a helpful repository where I can write about my progress. Updated my blog using ghost and ensured it was hosted on heroku.

**Thoughts:** I am deciding whether to do frontend/backend development or do some data science kungfu. I also keep a blog on my progress [here](https://tomiwaxyz.herokuapp.com/), to keep things fun for me
